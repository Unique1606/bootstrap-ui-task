Bootstrap 5 UI Practice Project
Project Overview

This project was created as part of an internship task to practice UI design using Bootstrap 5.
The main goal was to understand how Bootstrap components work and how they can be combined to build clean and responsive web pages.

Instead of copying full example pages, I explored different Bootstrap examples and created my own layout by mixing and adjusting components.

Pages Included

The project contains three main pages:

Home Page
Includes a navigation bar, hero section, feature cards, and footer.

About Page
Explains the purpose of the project and what I learned while building it.

Contact Page
Contains a simple contact form designed using Bootstrap form components.

All pages are responsive and work properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)

Git & GitHub

Step-by-Step Process

I reviewed the Bootstrap 5 documentation and examples to understand component structure.

I created a basic project folder and separate HTML files for each page.

A common navigation bar and footer were added to maintain consistency.

Each page was designed using Bootstrap grid system and utility classes.

Basic custom CSS was added to improve spacing and visual appearance.

The layout was tested on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

The project was pushed to GitHub and deployed.

Resources & Tools Used

Bootstrap official documentation

Bootstrap examples

Basic online references for CSS

AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used for guidance and clarification during development.

Challenges Faced

Adjusting spacing between sections

Making the UI look clean without over-styling

Understanding responsive behavior of the grid system

These were handled by testing different utility classes and checking layout on multiple screen sizes.

What I Learned
